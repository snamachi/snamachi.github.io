      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Logic, Computation, & Methodology at Carnegie Mellon University’s philosophy department. 
        My work takes from inspiration formal epistemology to solve problems within various domains of theoretical computer science, e.g. distributed consensus, game theory, and cryptography.

        <h3>Topological Semantics for Common Inductive Knowledge</h3>
        <p>
          This project draws on insights in learning theory to provide a novel formal account of common inductive knowledge. 
          Following Kelly in <i>The Logic of Reliable Inquiry</i>, we cash out learnability in terms of limit decidability and take as primitives agents’ information bases over possible worlds. 
          After defining common inductive knowledge in topological terms, we show how our semantics helps characterize the solutions to an 'inductive' version of the coordinated attack problem.

        <h3>Eliciting Causal Bayesian Networks with Scoring Rules</h3>
        <p>
          A framework for learning causal structures through proper scoring rules, combining elements of 
          Bayesian elicitation and causal discovery. Examines the theoretical soundness and robustness 
          of elicitation mechanisms under uncertainty.

        <h3>Resource Bounded Randomness for Instantiating Cryptographic Security</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00224-014-9545-9">Tadaki & Doi 2015</a> show that Martin-Löf (ML) random sequences, can serve to safely instantiate any signature scheme proven secure in the random oracle model. 
          Unfortunately, ML random sequences are not computable. Till now, it is an open conjecture whether all signature schemes proven secure in the random oracle model can be safely instantiated by a computable hash function. 
          This project uses tools from resource bounded randomness to prove this conjecture.
